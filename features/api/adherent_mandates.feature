Feature:
  In order to manage adherent mandates
  As a logged-in user
  I should be able to access adherent mandates API

  Scenario Outline: As a user granted with local scope, I can not get adherent mandates without adherent.uuid attribute
    Given I am logged with "<user>" via OAuth client "JeMengage Web" with scope "jemengage_admin"
    And I send a "GET" request to "/api/v3/elected_adherent_mandates?scope=<scope>"
    Then the response status code should be 400
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    {
        "detail": "Filter \"adherent.uuid\" is required.",
        "title": "An error occurred",
