Feature:
  In order to get adherents' information
  As a referent
  I should be able to acces adherents API data

  Background:
    Given I freeze the clock to "2018-04-17"
    And the following fixtures are loaded:
      | LoadUserData                       |
      | LoadAdherentData                   |
      | LoadEmailSubscriptionHistoryData   |
      | LoadCommitteeMembershipHistoryData |
      | LoadClientData                     |

  Scenario: As a non logged-in user I can not access the adherents count information
    When I am on "/api/statistics/adherents/count"
    Then the response status code should be 401

  Scenario: As an adherent I can not access the adherents count information
    When I am logged as "jacques.picard@en-marche.fr"
    And I am on "/api/statistics/adherents/count"
    Then the response status code should be 401

  Scenario: As a referent I can access the adherents count information
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/oauth/v2/token" with parameters:
      | key           | value                                        |

      | scope         | read:stats                                   |
    And I add the access token to the Authorization header
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/statistics/adherents/count?referent=referent@en-marche-dev.fr"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON should be equal to:

  Scenario: As a non logged-in user I can not access the managed by referent adherents count information
