@api
Feature:
  In order to get scopes of an adherent
  I should be able to request them via the API

  Scenario:
    Given the following fixtures are loaded:
      | LoadAdherentData                |
      | LoadClientData                  |
      | LoadDistrictData                |
      | LoadReferentTagData             |
      | LoadGeoZoneData                 |
      | LoadReferentTagsZonesLinksData  |
    When I am logged with "deputy@en-marche-dev.fr" via OAuth client "Data-Corner"
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/v3/scopes"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
    [
      {
        "code": "deputy",
        "zones": [
          {
            "uuid": "e3f0bf9d-906e-11eb-a875-0242ac150002",
            "code": "75-1",
            "name": "Paris (1)"
          }
        ],
        "apps": [
          "data_corner"
        ]
      }
    ]
    """
