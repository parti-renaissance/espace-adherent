Feature:
  In order to track push tokens
  As a logged-in adherent or device
  I should be able to post and delete push tokens

  Scenario: As a logged-in adherent I can add and remove a push token
    Given I am logged with "michelle.dufour@example.ch" via OAuth client "JeMengage Mobile" with scope "jemarche_app"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    When I send a "POST" request to "/api/v3/push-token" with body:
    """
    {
      "identifier": "abc123",
      "source": "je_marche"
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201

    When I send a "DELETE" request to "/api/v3/push-token/abc123"
    Then the response status code should be 204

  Scenario: As a logged-in adherent I can not remove a token i am not author of
    Given I am logged with "michelle.dufour@example.ch" via OAuth client "JeMengage Mobile" with scope "jemarche_app"
    When I send a "DELETE" request to "/api/v3/push-token/token-francis-jemarche-2"
    Then the response status code should be 403

  Scenario: As a logged-in device I can add and remove a push token
    Given I am logged with device "device_2" via OAuth client "JeMengage Mobile" with scope "jemarche_app"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    When I send a "POST" request to "/api/v3/push-token" with body:
    """
    {
      "identifier": "new-token-device-2-jemarche",
      "source": "je_marche"
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201

    When I send a "DELETE" request to "/api/v3/push-token/new-token-device-2-jemarche"
    Then the response status code should be 204

  Scenario: As a logged-in device I can not remove a token i am not author of
    Given I am logged with device "device_2" via OAuth client "JeMengage Mobile" with scope "jemarche_app"
    When I send a "DELETE" request to "/api/v3/push-token/token-device-1-jemarche"
    Then the response status code should be 403
