    Background:
        When I am logged as "superadmin@en-marche-dev.fr" admin

    Scenario: Display list of adherents
        When I am on "/app/adherent/list"
        Then the response status code should be 200
        And I should see 32 "tbody tr" elements
        And I should see 13 "thead tr th" elements

    Scenario: A user update must trigger an event in RabbitMQ
        Given I am on "/app/adherent/list"
        And I follow "SCHMIDT"

        Then the response status code should be 200
